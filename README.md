My personal configuration files; mostly for GNU Emacs.

I currently use [https://voidlinux.org/](Void Linux) on my desktop and [https://endeavouros.com/](EndeavourOS) on my laptop.

I am planning to make the switch to NixOS soon, so my NixOS configuration will be coming soon.

If you are interested in trying my Emacs configuration:
```shell
  git clone https://github.com/stmonty/dotfiles && cd dotfiles
  ./install.sh
```
You will probably need to perform an `M-x package-refresh-contents` on startup for the first time and then restart GNU Emacs.
