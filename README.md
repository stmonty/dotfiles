My personal configuration files; mostly for GNU Emacs.

I currently use [NixOS](https://nixos.org) on my desktop. NixOS configurations coming soon.

If you are interested in trying my Emacs configuration:
```shell
  git clone https://github.com/stmonty/dotfiles && cd dotfiles
  ./install.sh
```
You will probably need to perform an `M-x package-refresh-contents` on startup for the first time and then restart GNU Emacs.
